    # Adpater configuration
    # This part is converted into the Plexil XML interface configuration file.
    # It is a list of mapping nodes, each describing a single adapter.
    # Adapter configuration example:
    # - type: FooAdapter
    #   attr:
    #     HostName: localhost
    #     Port: 3456
    #   args:
    #     name: bar
    #   verbatim-args:
    #     - tag: DefaultCommandAdapter
    #     - tag: CustomTag
    #       text: "some text to put in tag"
    #       attr:
    #         name: bar
    #
    # Explanation:
    # type:
    #   Each adapter must have a type, by which it is loaded.
    # attr:
    #   Enables to add XML attributes into the Adapter tag.
    #   The example shows some viewer parameters for hostname and port.
    # args:
    #   Allow passing of parameters to the adapter. Will be added as <Parameter>
    #   elements with an attribute key referencing the key and the value set as
    #   the tags text.
    # verbatim-args:
    #   Enables directly adding XML tags through the YAML configuration.
    #   It is a list of mappings, each mapping having the following entries.
    #   - tag (required): the XML tag name
    #   - text (optional): added to the text section of the tag
    #   - attr: attributes added to the XML tag.
    # verbatim-xml:
    #   Partial XML document which will be inserted as children in the adapter tag.
    adapters:
      # Do not use Utility, use FawkesLogging instead!
      # Do not use OSNativeTime, use FawkesTime instead!
      - type: ThreadName
        attr:
          name: PlexilExecutive
      - type: FawkesTimeAdapter
      - type: FawkesLoggingAdapter
      - type: BehaviorEngineAdapter
      - type: ProtobufCommAdapter
        attr:
          protos: "@BASEDIR@/src/agents/plexil2016/msgs"
      - type: NavGraphAdapter

    # A Listener is an object that reports on node state transitions
    # in the plan, and other execution events.
    # cf. http://plexil.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Interface_Configuration_File
    # The configuration supports the same structure as above for adapters.
    # Cf. there for possible values. Some examples are given below.
    listeners:
      # This enables using the Plexil viewer
      - type: LuvListener
        attr:
          Port: 49100
          HostName: 127.0.0.1
          Blocking: true
    #   # The PlanDebugListener outputs as "Node:clock", make sure to enable it in Debug.cfg
    #   - type: PlanDebugListener

    # The Behavior Engine adapter provides a generic skill_call, which can
    # always be declared as skill_call(...) and which takes the skill name
    # as the first parameter, and after that an even number of key/value pairs
    # for the named arguments of the skill.
    #
    # However, it may be desirable to have more descriptive names. This is
    # possible with the following configuration. Then, the adapter will register
    # itself for commands with each of the given names and perform the appropriate
    # mapping.
    skills:
      # Allows for a declaration as say(String text)
      # Note that the order of the arguments is important and must match the order
      # of the arguments in the Plexil declaration!
      - name: say
        args:
          - type: String
            name: text
        template: say{text=?(text)s, wait=true}

      - name: goto
        args:
          - type: String
            name: place
        template: ppgoto{place=?(place)s}
