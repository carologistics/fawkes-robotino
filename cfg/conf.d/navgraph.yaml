  # Cost factor to decide whether to use new or old plan after re-planning.
  # The cost of the old (remaining partial) plan is multiplied with this
  # factor and then compared to the new plan's cost. Only if the new plan
  # is not more expensive than this result, it is used.
  # For example, when setting this to 1.0, the new plan is only considered
  # if it is at most as expensive as the current plan. When setting this to
  # 2.0, the new plan may be up to twice as expensive as the current plan
  # to switch.
