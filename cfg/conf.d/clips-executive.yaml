  # automatically pre-require redefine-warning feature? Enabling
  # this in the plugin instead of in the initial code (init.clp) is
  # beneficial because it already catches errors in said file.

  # Automatically assert the (start) fact after successful initialization,
  # otherwise wait until the an enable message has been received

  # If set to true, will trigger the assertion of a (time (now)) fact in
  # each loop. This can be used to trigger loop events in CLIPS.

  # If set to true will force the acquisition of the skiller control.
  # This is particularly useful to kick an SkillGUI which is holding
  # the lock just due to an oversight.
