navgraph-clusters:

  # Prefix for position interfaces that will be opened with cluster
  # centroid information.
  interface-prefix: "/laser-cluster/robots/"

  # If a cluster centroid is as close or closer than this threshold
  # to an edge that very edge will be marked as blocke.
  close-threshold: 0.5

  # Minimum visibility history value a cluster must have before it is
  # considered for determining blockade information
  min-visibility-history: 5

  # Set the mode to enforce the constraints.
  # block: use an edge constraint to block edges close to clusters from
  #        expansion during A* search
  # static-cost:  apply a static cost factor to edges close to clusters
  constraint-mode: distance-cost

  static-cost:
    # Cost factor to apply to edges close to clusters
    cost-factor: 2.0

  # Parameters for the distance cost mode.
  # Any obstacle closer than dist-min will be assigned cost-max,
  # farther away than dist-max will ignored. In between the cost span
  # is scaled linearly to the distance range, with closer obstacles
  # getting higher costs.
  distance-cost:
    cost-min: 2
    cost-max: 4
    dist-min: 2
    dist-max: 4
