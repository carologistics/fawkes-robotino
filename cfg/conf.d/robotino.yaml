  base_frame: !frame base_link

  # Minimum time in milliseconds between two Robotino sensor readings.
  # Lower values increase the machine load (considerably) but decrease
  # the average sensor data age. Zero means receive as fast as possible
  # without waiting between receive calls

  bumper:
    # Set to true to enable the emergency stop on bumper contact (provided
    # by OpenRobotino, or false to keep going (warning, you should handle

  gyro:
    # Enable Gyro publishing? This creates an IMUInterface and publishes
    # the gyro data if available via OpenRobotino. If enabled and the gyro
    # is not available, properly writes "-1 invalid indicator" (cf. IMUInterface)
    # If disabled, no interface will be opened and written. Recommended if you
    # intend to use the imu plugin for gyro access
    # If you enable this, you should also set the odometry mode to copy
    enable: false

  odometry:

    # Odometry mode, one of "calc" or "copy"
    # calc: calculate on our own based on IMUInterface and velocity data
    # copy: copy values as-is from OpenRobotino
    # If you set this to calc, you should disable the gyro support in the
    # robotino plugin and instead use the imu plugin with the gyro connected
    # directly to the Fawkes machine.

      # Correction factors for odometry calculation
      correction:
        # If wheel odometry is used (not the gyro) multiple the odometry delta
        # with this factor, that is an empirical value that you need to
