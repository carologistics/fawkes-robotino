  # The green light is activated whenever a skill finals
  # (Note that it is not activated if a subskill finals, as the skiller
  # currently does not change the data on the skiller interface right now)

  # The red light is activated whenever a skill fails
  # (Note that the skiller state is always switched to fail if any subskill
  # fails!)

  # This is the number as it appears on the Robotino, i.e. 1 to 8, not
  # the interface index!
  # You can find these numbers by closely inspecting the port in which the
  # signal light is connected.
  # The brown cable is connected to the red lamp,
  # the green one to the green one
  # and the yellow one to the yellow one.

  # This settings sets where the motor state should be output.

  # When the last skill failed, the state switches almost immediately to
