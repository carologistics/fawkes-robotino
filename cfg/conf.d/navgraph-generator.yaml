    line_segmentation_max_iterations: 250

    # Minimum number of points that must be inliers to consider a line.
    # Note that this depends on the resolution of the map and the minimum
    # length for lines you want to detect. For example, with a resolution
    # of 0.05 (5cm per cell) and 10 min inliers, the minimum length you
    # can detect is 0.5 m (10 * 0.05).

    # To have contiguous lines without large holes, a clustering is
    # applied after the initial line segmentation. The following
    # specifies the cluster tolerance, i.e. the maximum distance between
    # a cluster point and any neighbour and the quota of points which
    # must at least remain after clustering of the original line.

    # Minimum and maximum length of line to consider it. Ignored if less
    # than zero.
    # Note: we use the cell centers for line detection. That means
    # that lines are always one cell size (resolution step) shorter
    # than what you see on the map. For instance, with a resolution of
    # 0.05 (5cm per cell) and a wall that is 1.0 m long, it would be
    # detected as a 0.95 m long line (the outer two cells each inset
    # by half the cell size, in our example that's 2 * 0.025 = 0.05,
    # then actual length 1.0 - 0.05 = 0.95.  Additionally, if you have
    # walls that meet, e.g. in perpendicular, the some points of one
    # of the lines will be accounted to the other.  For example,
    # consider a corner with two walls A and B. Let's assume the line
    # for A is found first. Now when gathering support points, we
    # consider the line segmentation distance threshold which is 2 x
    # cell size. Due to this we will sample two cells of wall B for
    # the detection of wall A.
    # Therefore carefully choose the minimum length.
