  # offsets between object pose from the object tracking plugin and the target
  #  frame before starting the routine (target in both x and z), above the
  #  workpiece (top, only x is changed), at the pick/put position in the
  #  routine (routine, only z is changed), and at the end of the gripper (end,
  #  only z is changed) routine (end)
  # z positions assume the wp is a C3 and reduce the height if its lower change
  #  y direction through host_specific static frame
