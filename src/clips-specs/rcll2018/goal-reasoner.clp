; Goal reasoner for goals with sub-types. Goals without sub-types are NOT
; handled.
;
; Basic functionalities:
;  - Select MAINTAIN goals
;  - Finish sub-goals of finished parent goals to ensure proper cleanup
;  - Expand goals that are inner nodes of a goal tree
;    (the other goals are expanded in the goal-expander)
;  - Automatically evaluate all goals with low priority
;    Special evaluation for specific goals with default priority
;  - Clean up and remove executed goals
;    Reject formulated inner production tree goals if no suitable sub-goal
;    could be formulated
;  - Reject formulated production tree goals once some leaf goal is dispatched
;
;
; The intended goal life-cycle of the production tree (assuming no goal gets
; rejected due to resource locks) can be summarized to:
;  - Formulate inner tree nodes to expand the root
;  - Formulate all currently achievable production goals
;  - Reject all inner tree nodes that have no sub-goal
;  - Recursively dispatch inner goals until a leaf goal is dispatched
;  - Reject all tree nodes that are not dispatched
;  - Once a leaf goal is finished and evaluated, the outcome is recursively
;    handed back to the root
;  - After the root is evaluated all other tree goals (by the time in mode
;    RETRACTED) are deleted
;  - The root gets reformulated and selected
;
; If a leaf goal has to be rejected, the parent goal dispatches another
; leaf goal instead. If this is not possible then the parent is rejected and
; recursively another goal is tried until either one leaf can be dispatched or
; all goals are rejected (this should never happen, since we have WAIT goals),
; leading the root to be rejected and reformulated.
