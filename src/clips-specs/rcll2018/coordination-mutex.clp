; Coordination through Mutual Exclusion (Locks)
; Mutexes are a principal to allow only a single entity access to a critical
; section. This specific implementation is meant to serve a group of robots
; for distributed locking. We do so by utilizing the robot-memory mutex
; capabilities.
;
; For each mutex, there exists a mutex fact. It is automatically create the
; first time a lock is requested. It may be created manually, or through
; mutex-create-async. Then, it will be added as soon as the update has
; propagated to the majority of the replica set.
;
; A lock may be requested through two ways:
; 1. call (mutex-try-lock-async ?name)
;    This is the preferred method. This will trigger acquisition of the lock
;    on the named mutex.
; 2. assert (or modify) a mutex fact of the form:
;    (mutex (name ?name) (request LOCK) (response NONE))
;
; Once a lock as been acquired, the response will be ACQUIRED, the state
; LOCKED, and locked-by will be the output of (cx-identity).
; A lock may be rejected, i.e., if there was a race and another entity
; acquired the lock first. Then, tje response will be REJECTED, the state
; LOCKED, and locked-by the name of the other entity.
;
; A lock may be released through two ways:
; 1. call (mutex-unlock-async ?name)
;    This is the preferred method. This will trigger asynchronous release of
;    the named mutex.
; 2. Modify the corresponding ?mf <- (mutex (name ?name)) fact like this:
;    (modify ?mf (request UNLOCK) (response NONE))
;
; Once the lock has been released, the lock will either be in state:
; - OPEN: lock has been released
; - LOCKED and locked-by an entity other than (cx-identity): the lock has
;   already been acquired by another entity.
;
; Mishandling is indicated through the "ERROR" response. The error-msg
; contains a user-readable error message.
;
; When handling mutex facts directly, you may ever only modify the request
; field, and the response field to set it to NONE (and NONE only). A request
; may NOT be aborted. If a request is PENDING no other request may be started
; or undefined behavior will occur.
