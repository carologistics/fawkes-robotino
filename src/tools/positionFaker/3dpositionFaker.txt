NAME
----
skillet - Skiller remote instruction console tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*skillet* [-r 'host[:port]'] ['skill string'...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool is used to instruct the skiller plugin remotely from the
console. In a sense it is a very basic version of the SkillGUI. It
allows to give a skill string on the command line or type in a skill
string, which is then ordered for execution by the skiller.

All arguments on the command line are merged into one skill string, it
is therefore not possible to execute multiple skill strings at
once. This may change in the future. It is recommended to quote the
skill string into one argument.

SKILL SHELL
-----------
If skillet is run without a skill string it opens a skill shell. It
supports a few custom commands, any other string is passed verbatim to
the skiller.

Commands
~~~~~~~~
 *cont*::
	Order any consecutively entered command in continuous mode,
	that is keep executing the skill string until it succeeds or
	fails, until an explicit stop is send, or until another skill
	stirng is executed.

 *oneshot*::
	Any consecutively executed skill string is executed as a
	one-shot skill, i.e. only one iteration is performed with the
	given skill string.

 *stop*::
	Stop a currently running continuous skill string.
