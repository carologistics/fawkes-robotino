      The visibilitiy history indicates the number of consecutive positive or negative
      sightings. If the history is negative, there have been as many negative sightings
      (object not visible) as the absolute value of the history. A positive value denotes
      as many positive sightings. 0 shall only be used during the initialization of the
      interface or if the visibility history is not updated.

     Angle between the x-axis of frame (e.g. the pov of the robot) and the center of 
     the detected object
    </field>
