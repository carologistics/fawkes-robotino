TODO:

* Iterate over all the ifdefines and make the naming consistenet
* look how to adpt ur own namespace...call it bridge



Changes and Why:
#Web_server on_msg handler moved fom disptech:
	-the handler is no longer ()instance specific 
	-I dont want to do websocket stuff from the BridgeManager (extracing the payload and finding the session by its handler)
	-its much cleaner to just make a call to the BrigeManager with the session_object and the json string.
