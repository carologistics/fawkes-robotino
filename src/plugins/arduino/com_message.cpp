/** @class ArduinoComMessage "com_message.h"
 * Arduino communication message.
 *
 * This object is used to create messages to be read by the Arduino
 * flashed with fawkes_plugin_comm.ino.
 *
 * This object is used to create messages to send and parse messages
 * to read. It is designed to be generic, i.e., it provides methods to
 * add messages and its fields and to iterate over commands and read
 * fields. These methods must be called in proper sequence, no command
 * type specific processing is performed within the class. This
 * approach was chosen since we do not strive for a user-facing
 * generic transport, but rather for a minimal method to interact with
 * Arduino's microcontroller.
 *
 * A message strictly differentiates between a reading and a writing
 * mode, depending on the constructor with which it was created. The
 * reading mode is used to parse received messages and provide access
 * to its commands, the writing mode to construct messages to send.
 * Furthermore, the message assumes quick run-throughs, i.e., after
 * requesting the buffer of a writing message once, it is fixed and
 * will not be re-generated after further additions.
 *
 * Terminology is a mix in part due to the naming in OpenArduino:
 * - Message: our representation of a message to send
 * - Command: a command field within a message, this is called tag
 *            and also command in OpenArduino. We chose the latter.
