LLSF 2012+ agent

This agent plays a slightly extended version of the 2012 game. This means
while effectively only being able to produce a P (now P1 in 2013) it uses
the 2013 refbox to play the game in simulation.

To play this against the refbox change the initial machine distribution in
the globals.clp file (of the refbox!) to contain only T1, T2, and T3
machines.
